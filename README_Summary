Project Description: The user is able to use the command line or a GUI to search the 30 most recent edits of a Wikipedia article. They can use this program in two different ways: GUI and command line.

Project Objectives: 
1. The URL must be formatted correctly after user inputs what they want to search. Any spaces must be replaced to fit a URL's format.
2. It must handle errors like: if the user inputs nothing, if the user inputs an invalid page, and if there is a network error. 
3. When searching recent edits, key information such as the username and timestamp should be organized and formatted for easy readability. 
4. Creating a user friendly menu to choose the way you want to search.

Entry Points: We have provided a user friendly menu where you can choose if you want to search through the command line or the GUI. Once running the program you will be given the options.
